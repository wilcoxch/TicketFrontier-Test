WINDOWS 7/ JAVA JDK 1.6.0_25 / jsoup-1.10.3.jar

TEST2 utilizes Jsoup, a library that I've included in the TEST2/TEST2 folder(jsoup-1.10.3.jar)
StatParser.java should be found in TEST2/src which is the main program.
Running should be as simple as including that library in the classpath.

TEST3 should be as simple as running 'javac FileParser.java' from the command line and then using 'java FileParser [testfile]' to run.
